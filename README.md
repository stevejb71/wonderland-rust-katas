## How to Do the Katas

First, clone or fork this repo. Each of the katas are in their own
directory and are self contained Rust cargo projects.  You `cd`
into the project and run `cargo test` to show the failing tests, then
complete the code to make the tests pass. Each project has the
instructions in its own _README.md_ file.

If you don't have Rust installed yet, follow these [instructions](https://www.rust-lang.org/downloads.html)
to get it. The latest stable release should be sufficient for these katas.

For example, to get started on the _alphabet cipher_ kata first.

1. Clone or Fork this repo
2. cd `alphabet_cipher`
3. run `cargo test`
4. Check out the alphabet cipher instructions in the _README.md_.
5. Add the code in the src/lib.rs to make the tests pass.
