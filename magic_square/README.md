# magic-square

This puzzle comes from Lewis Carroll.  The magic part is when the
values on a square are arranged so that adding them up in any direction results in
a constant sum.

Lewis Carroll's original magic square used Victorian postal values, which were, in old English pennies :

```
½d, 1½d, 2d, 2½d, 3d, 3½d, 4d, 5d
```

You need to arrange them in a 3 x 3 matrix so that:

1. The sums of numbers in each row = magic number
2. The sums of numbers in each column = magic number
3. The sums of numbers in each diagonal = magic number
